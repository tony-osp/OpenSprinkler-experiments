This is a fork of the OpenSprinkler Arduino source code. This is Open Source code.

Current state of the code is - experimental, work in progress.

It is based on https://github.com/rayshobby/opensprinkler/tree/master/OpenSprinkler%20Controller/software/arduino-code

Actually this particular fork is an evolution of the variation of the OpenSprinkler source I got from Ray's forum: http://rayshobby.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=308

As compared with original Ray's code this version was modified to run on a standard Arduino Mega-type hardware with WizNet5100 Ethernet shield. 

My contribution to the code so far includes SD card support for logging and some bug fixes.
