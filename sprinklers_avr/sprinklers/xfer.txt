To upload files to the Sprinklers controller from windows box you can use any tftp client.

For example, you can use standard, built-in Windows tftp client, which can be added from
Control Panel->Programs and Features->Turn Windows Features On/Off->TFTP Client.

Command line:
tfpt -i controller-ip-address PUT index.htm "web/index.htm"

Instead of index.htm you can specify any other file to upload.
