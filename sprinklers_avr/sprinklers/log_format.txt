Log file formats:

System log (files in /logs directory):

File name: mm-yyyy.log

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm:ss" format. Note: seconds part may be absent
3. Event source (e.g. "sys")
4. Event type (1/2/3 for error/warning/info)
5. The rest is event-specific, and could be treated as a string

One event per line, max line length - 255 characters. Encoding - ASCII.

Watering events log (files in /watering.log directory)

File name: mm-yyyy.wat

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm" format
3. Zone ID (one or two digits)
4. Run time in minutes
5. Schedule ID
6. Adjustment
7. Weather underground adjustment

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

***Sensors data***

Water flow meters data (files in /wflow.log directory)

File name: mm-yyyy.wfl

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm" format
3. Water sensor ID (one or two digits)
4. Water flow reading (e.g. "2.5")
5. Duration in seconds

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

When multiple water flow sensors are installed additional sensors data can be represented by separate records, one record per sensor.
Water flow readings are assumed to be in gallons.
Time duration indicates the period of time this water flow reading is for. E.g. if water flow reading is 2.5, and time is 300,
it means that during the last 5 minutes (300 seconds) sensor detected the flow of 2.5 gallons of water.
This information allows data consumers to calculate accurate flow rates while allowing variable logging rate speed -
some of the sensors may be sending data every minute, other sensors may be sending data every 10 minutes etc.
Also it allows data consumers to determine periods of activity and inactivity.

Water flow records are expected to be for periods when there is detectable water flow - absence of a record indicates
absence of the water flow. When water flow is detected updates/records are expected every few minutes.



Temperature sensors data (files in /tempr.log directory)

File name: mm-yyyy.tem

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm" format
3. Temperature sensor ID (one or two digits)
4. Temperature (e.g. "70.5")

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

Sensor readings represent reading values at the time of the timestamp.
E.g. if the reading is 70.5, it means that at the moment of time defined by the timestamp actual temperature was 70.5F.
Temperature is assumed to be in Fahrenheit.


Humidity sensors data (files in /humid.log directory)

File name: mm-yyyy.hum

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm" format
3. Humidity sensor ID (one or two digits)
4. Humidity reading (e.g. "60")

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

Sensor readings represent reading values at the time of the timestamp.
E.g. if the reading is 60, it means that at the moment of time defined by the timestamp actual humidity was 60%.
Humidity is assumed to be in %.
