Log file formats:

System log (files in /logs directory):

File name: mm-yyyy.log 

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm:ss" format. Note: seconds part may be absent
3. Event source (e.g. "sys")
4. Event type (1/2/3 for error/warning/info)
5. The rest is event-specific, and could be treated as a string

One event per line, max line length - 255 characters. Encoding - ASCII.

Watering events log (files in /watering.log directory)

File name: wat-yyyy.nnn, where yyyy - year, nnn - zone number. Zone number is always 3 digits (padded with zeroes).

First line of file defines columns:

Month,Day,Time,Run time(min),ScheduleID,Adjustment,WUAdjustment

This first line is helpful for applications capable of importing CSV files (e.g. Excel), it is also used to have easy to use
format information since it defines columns meaning.

The rest of the file consists of the records of the following format:

1. Month (one or two digits)
2. Day of the month (one or two digits)
3. Time in "hh:mm" format
4. Run time in minutes
5. Schedule ID
6. Adjustment
7. Weather underground adjustment

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

***Sensors data***

Water flow meters data (files in /wflow.log directory)

File name: wflmm-yy.nnn, where mm - month, yy - year, nnn - sensor number. Sensor number is always 3 digits (padded with zeroes).

First line of file defines columns:

Day,Time,WaterFlow,Duration(sec)

This first line is helpful for applications capable of importing CSV files (e.g. Excel), it is also used to have easy to use
format information since it defines columns meaning.

The rest of the file consists of the records of the following format:

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm" format
3. Water flow reading (e.g. 2.5)
4. Duration in seconds

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

When multiple water flow sensors are installed additional sensors data can be represented by separate files.
Water flow readings are assumed to be in gallons.
Time duration indicates the period of time this water flow reading is for. E.g. if water flow reading is 2.5, and time is 300,
it means that during the last 5 minutes (300 seconds) sensor detected the flow of 2.5 gallons of water.
This information allows data consumers to calculate accurate flow rates while allowing variable logging rate speed -
some of the sensors may be sending data every minute, other sensors may be sending data every 10 minutes etc.
Also it allows data consumers to determine periods of activity and inactivity.

Water flow records are expected to be for periods when there is detectable water flow - absence of a record indicates
absence of the water flow. When water flow is detected updates/records are expected every few minutes.



Temperature sensors data (files in /tempr.log directory)

File name: temMM-YY.nnn, where MM - month, YY - year, nnn - sensor number. Sensor number is always 3 digits (padded with zeroes).

First line of file defines columns:

Day,Time,Temperature(F)

This first line is helpful for applications capable of importing CSV files (e.g. Excel), it is also used to have easy to use
format information since it defines columns meaning.

The rest of the file consists of the records of the following format:

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm" format
3. Temperature (e.g. 70.5)

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

Sensor readings represent reading values at the time of the timestamp.
E.g. if the reading is 70.5, it means that at the moment of time defined by the timestamp actual temperature was 70.5F.
Temperature is assumed to be in Fahrenheit.


Humidity sensors data (files in /humid.log directory)

File name: humMM-YY.nnn, where MM - month, YY - year, nnn - sensor number. Sensor number is always 3 digits (padded with zeroes).

First line of file defines columns:

Day,Time,Humidity

This first line is helpful for applications capable of importing CSV files (e.g. Excel), it is also used to have easy to use
format information since it defines columns meaning.

The rest of the file consists of the records of the following format:

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm" format
3. Humidity reading (e.g. 60)

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

Sensor readings represent reading values at the time of the timestamp.
E.g. if the reading is 60, it means that at the moment of time defined by the timestamp actual humidity was 60%.
Humidity is assumed to be in %.


Pressure sensors data (files in /pressure.log directory)

File name: preMM-YY.nnn, where MM - month, YY - year, nnn - sensor number. Sensor number is always 3 digits (padded with zeroes).

First line of file defines columns:

Day,Time,Pressure

This first line is helpful for applications capable of importing CSV files (e.g. Excel), it is also used to have easy to use
format information since it defines columns meaning.

The rest of the file consists of the records of the following format:

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm" format
3. Pressure reading (e.g. 1020)

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

Sensor readings represent reading values at the time of the timestamp.
E.g. if the reading is 1020, it means that at the moment of time defined by the timestamp actual atmospheric pressure was 1020.
Pressure is assumed to be in mbars.
